# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation  

A **realistic 3D solar system** simulation using **Three.js** that allows users to explore planets orbiting dynamically around the sun.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Realistic Orbits** – Planets revolve around the Sun with accurate speeds.  
✅ **Textured Planets** – High-quality textures for a realistic look.  
✅ **Saturn’s Rings** – Special ring effect added for Saturn.  
✅ **Zoom & Rotate** – Use the mouse to navigate around the solar system.  
✅ **Light Effects** – Sun emits light, casting realistic shadows.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Three.js** – 3D graphics rendering  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Handles planet movement and interactions  
- **OrbitControls.js** – Allows zoom and rotation  
- **GLTFLoader.js** – For loading 3D planet textures

## 🚀 How to Run Locally  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-solar-system.git
   ```
2. **Install a local server** (if not already installed):  
   - Python users:  
     ```sh
     python -m http.server 8080
     ```

     npx serve .
     ```
3. **Open** your browser and go to:  
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
4. **Explore** the solar system by rotating and zooming in!  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- 🛰️ **Add Moons** – Simulate moon orbits around planets.  
- 🌍 **More Realism** – Improve planet surface details and atmosphere effects.  
- 🔭 **Planet Info Panel** – Display planet facts when clicked.
